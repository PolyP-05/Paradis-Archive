        <h2 class="summary-text">Plot Overview</h2>
        <p class="para">Eren Yeager lives in the walled city of Shiganshina, humanity's last refuge from giant humanoid
            creatures called Titans. When the outer wall, Wall Maria, is breached by the Colossal and Armored Titans,
            Eren's mother is killed, driving him to vow revenge. He joins the military alongside his friends Mikasa
            Ackerman and Armin Arlert.During the Battle of Trost, Eren discovers he can transform into a Titan. The
            Survey Corps, led
            by Erwin
            Smith and Levi Ackerman, recruit him to help reclaim Wall Maria. Eren later fights Annie Leonhart, the
            Female Titan, and learns that Titans exist within the walls themselves.More mysteries unfold when Reiner
            Braun and Bertholt Hoover reveal themselves as the Armored
            and Colossal
            Titans. Eren awakens the Coordinate power, allowing him to control other Titans. It's discovered that Titans
            are transformed humans. Meanwhile, the Beast Titan appears, and political conspiracies reveal Historia Reiss
            as the true royal heir.

        <p class="para">Eren learns his father Grisha Yeager stole the Founding Titan from the royal family and passed
            it to him.
            After overthrowing corrupt rulers, Historia becomes Queen. The Survey Corps retake Shiganshina, but suffer
            heavy losses—Erwin dies, and Armin inherits the Colossal Titan. They finally uncover the truth: their world
            is an island called Paradis, and the rest of humanity lives across the sea under the rule of Marley.Years
            later, Eren allies with his half-brother Zeke Yeager, launching an attack on Marley and
            starting the
            Rumbling, releasing thousands of Wall Titans to destroy the world. The remaining Survey Corps and Marleyan
            soldiers unite to stop him. Mikasa ultimately kills Eren, ending the Titan's curse and freeing
            humanity.Peace slowly returns, though tension remains between Paradis and the outside world. Mikasa
            buries Eren
            beneath a tree in Shiganshina — the same place where his journey began. Centuries later, civilization again
            falls into war, and a boy approaches the same tree, suggesting the cycle of history may repeat.</p>

    </div>
    <button class="accordion">The Fall of Shiganshina</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 1 and 2 (season 1) : </p>
        <p>The first few Attack on Titan arcs focus on Eren’s motivation, and the eventual betrayal by Annie, Reiner,
            Berthold. The story begins when Eren, Armin, and Mikasa’s life changed for the worse as Titans barged into
            Shiganshina and destroyed everything. Young Eren had to witness his mother being devoured by a titan,
            scarring him for life and infusing his heart with vengeance and rage.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">104th Training Corps</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 3 and 4 (season 1) : </p>
        <p>The training period for the cadets was harsh and brutal. However, it also required them to be quick, agile,
            and stable. In this period, Reiner, Berthold, and Annie made their name known among the cadets. Especially
            Annie, whose hand-to-hand combat skill dominated even Reiner and Eren. In the end, the cadets enlisted in
            their desired corps, with Eren, Armin, and Mikasa entering the Survey Corps.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">The Battle of Trost</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 5 to 13 (season 1) : </p>
        <p>The main trio enlisted as cadets for the 104th Training Corps. Their first mission was to prevent an
            unexpected Titan attack from spreading. Unfortunately, Eren was one of the victims that fell into the
            jaws
            of the Titans. Unbeknownst to him, he had a power that allowed him and his comrades to push the Titan
            back,
            and he turned out to be a Titan shifter.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">The Female Titan</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 14 to 25 (season 1) : </p>
        <p>Eren turning into a Titan proved to be a more troublesome circumstance. First, it was a clear sign that not
            all Titans are mindless. Second, there could be Titan shifters among the Titans, and Eren was their prime
            target. This proved to be true with the revelation that the Female Titan was none other than Annie Leonhart.
            However, in a desperate attempt to escape, Annie encased herself in a hardened Titan diamond, rendering her
            unconscious for years.

    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Clash of Titans</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 26 to 37 (season 2) : </p>
        <p>The situation worsened when Reiner and Berthold revealed themselves as the Arm
            The situation grew dire with the appearance of more series of Titan attacks. There was a suspicion of a wall
            breach along Wall Maria. It was even more strange when Connie encountered a paralyzed Titan on top of his
            home. Strangely, that Titan resembled his mother. Reiner urged him to retreat and to brush it off.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Royal Government Arc</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Anime: Episode 38 to 49 (season 3) : </p>
        <p>After freeing Eren from Reiner and Berthold's grasp, the Survey Corps return, battered and exhausted.
            However, another problem awaited them inside the walls. It was revealed that Historia's father, Rod Reiss,
            wanted to restore the Reiss family's reign over Paradis Island. He wanted Historia to take Eren's Titan
            power and use her to threaten anyone who opposed him.
            <br> This attempt failed, however. In his desperation, Rod Reiss consumed his own Titan injection and turned
            into
            a massive Titan, even larger than the Colossal Titan. Thankfully, he was taken down and Historia rose to be
            the true ruler of Paradis Island. While paying respect by kissing the newly crowned Queen, Eren received an
            unexpected revelation of the future. That vision led him to be sure that his father hid the Titan's secret
            in his basement, prompting the Survey Corps to go back to Shiganshina.

    <button class="accordion">Return to Shiganshina Arc</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 50 to 59 (season 3) : </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Survey Corp's venture to Shiganshina was not without surprise. Reiner and Berthold
            rejoined with their true commander, Zeke, who was the Beast Titan. With the help of their other comrade,
            Pieck the Cart Titan, they pinpointed the Survey Corps location and an intense battle ensued.
            <br> Thanks to Commander Erwin's sacrifice, a few of the Survey Corps managed to survive and pushed Zeke's
            force
            to retreat, though with a casualty on their side too. The Survey Corps managed to capture Berthold, the
            Colossal Titan shifter. Arwin and Commander Erwin were both critically injured. However, it was decided that
            Armin was the one to save. The survivors fed Berthold to Armin in his Titan form, making him the Colossal
            Titan holder.

    <button class="accordion">The Marley Arc</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>60 to 68 (season 4) : </p>
        <p>The last two Attack on Titan arcs showcase Eren's complex shift into a villain. With the knowledge that there
            were other nations aside from Paradis Island, Eren slipped into Marley and planned his invasion. Throughout
            the preparation, he secretly met with Zeke and began concocting their plan to end Eldian's existence.
            <br>By the time the elaborate plan was launched, Eren delivered the first attack against Marley, supported
            by
            his comrades from the Survey Corps. The War Hammer Titan fell into Eren's possession, Zeke successfully
            snuck to the Eldian side, and they quickly retreated. This led to Reiner facing Eren once more.

    <button class="accordion">War for Paradis Arc</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Episode 69 to 89 (season 4) : </p>
        <p>Back to Paradis Island, Eren gained a radical loyal following who aimed to establish a new Eldian empire,
            the Yeagerist. Eren secretly informed he was planning to betray Zeke, seizing the royal lineage power and
            commencing the Rumbling.
            <br>Eren's Rumbling didn't sit right with the remaining Survey Corps. Destruction of the world was not what
            they
            wanted. However, Eren had already been on his way to trample the whole world. So, they had to catch up to
            him and stop him by any means.
